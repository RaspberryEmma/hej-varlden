A practice repo, containing my new million dollar app idea - it prints "Hello, world!" to command line.

Hello everyone!
I'm a postgrad student with the University of Southampton.
Currently, I am learning to use Git / GitHub.
My hope is to make meaningful contributions to open-source projects in the future.
Future me, best of luck.
